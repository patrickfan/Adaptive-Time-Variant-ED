# Adaptive-Time-Variant-ED

The Adaptive-Time-Variant ED model features an adaptive encoder that dynamically adjusts to evolving conditions at each forecast horizon. It processes historical hydrometeorological data and progressively incorporates forecasted inputs, ensuring a more comprehensive integration of information over time. A key aspect of this model is its dual-level parameter propagation mechanism, which enhances continuity and stability in multi-step forecasting. The first level involves propagating encoder and decoder weights from the initial prediction step to subsequent steps, providing a well-informed starting point for further training. The second level carries forward the LSTMâ€™s hidden and cell states, preserving short- and long-term dependencies across forecast horizons.
